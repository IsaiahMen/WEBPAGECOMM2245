  <h1>Portfolio: Examples of my Writting</h1>
  <p>On this Page I will be sharing some example of my writting from my blog posts.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of my writting as a blog post:</p>
  <p>Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft Montreal. It was released in November 2016 and is the sequel to the original Watch Dogs game. Set in an open-world rendition of the San Francisco Bay Area, the game combines hacking, stealth, and third-person shooting elements. In Watch Dogs 2, players assume the role of Marcus Holloway, a young hacker with exceptional skills, as he joins the hacking group DedSec to take down the corrupt establishment and powerful corporations that misuse technology to control society. The game explores themes of privacy, surveillance, and the impact of technology on modern life. Critical features of Watch Dogs 2 include the ability to hack into various electronic devices and infrastructure in the game world, such as security cameras, smartphones, and cars. The protagonist, Marcus, has multiple gadgets and tools to manipulate the environment and achieve objectives. The game also features a seamless online multiplayer mode where players can engage in cooperative missions or competitive activities with other players. Watch Dogs 2 was praised for its popularity because of its vibrant open-world setting, improved hacking mechanics, and a more charismatic protagonist than the first game. The game's tone is light-hearted and humorous, offering a different experience from its predecessor.</p>
